# JavaScript Mini Projects Practice

## Overview
This repository contains small JavaScript practice projects built to strengthen core JavaScript concepts before moving deeper into React and full MERN stack development.

## Learning Focus
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Functions and logic building
- Timers and async behavior
- UI interaction using JavaScript

## Repository Structure
Each project is stored in its own folder. Every project contains:

- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- project specific README.md

## Goal
Build strong JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on mini projects and maintain a consistent GitHub commit history.

## Notes
Projects will be added continuously as part of daily JavaScript practice before starting React.
